=====================

This is an example of python module.

-  `Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__ manages the project depedencies and
   lets you to configure and automize tasks like documentation
   generation, unit tests, ...
-  `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html>`__ generates
   the project documentation.
-  `Pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`__ manages unit tests.
-  `Conda <https://conda.io/docs/intro.html>`__: Package, dependency and
   environment management for any language: Python, R, Scala, Java,
   Javascript, C/ C++, FORTRAN

Gradle imports and installs locally a MiniConda env to install
dependencies without any conflit with your favorite environment.

You don't need to install Gradle or Conda on your computer. Just use
``gradlew`` command (Gradle Wrapper).
